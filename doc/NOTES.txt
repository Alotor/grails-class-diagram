0.4 backlog

Unassigned


Detailed feature & issue list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unassigned
 * add packages in source to provide more consistent logging (according to http://grails.markmail.org/search/?q=list%3Adev+#query:list%3Adev%20+page:2+mid:uunlkazqvgpvhaqt+state:results)
 * GUI spinner should be bigger & positioned over the graph, and run until image finished loading!
 * Report errors on server (ex dot/format errors) as grails errors. Remove alert in ajax error
 * Better enum support. Enums now outside packages
 * editable combobox on outputFormat
 * UI looks awful on IE7 (but who cares :)
 * DRY on plugin home URL (in ClassDiagramPlugin and in menubar)
 * test on windows
 * user should  be able to select domain class subset
 * Filter domain classes. Per class? per package ?
 * Extend diagram to non-domain classes (services, controllers, etc. etc.) 
 * Draw seqeunce diagrams based on recording (using meta.invokeMethod), and possibly UMLGraph.org (think graphviz is unsuited)
 * prefix class name with package (in nodename) to avoid name collissions. 
 * examine on which os jpg+waitFor fails
 * Keyboard shortcuts on menu

 Out on the limb
  * Cut restart time by having a separate server for the class diagram viewer (kind of like the grails console), that loads/reloads the domain classes only using application.addDomanClass/addArtifact or something similar?
     - Modularize and create eclipse-plugin ? 
  * Graphviz can attach urls to svg images. Here we could do a number of things:
     - add support for graph editing! (Or no? server reload takes too long!)
     - better: add support for browsing packages and classes, show source (intersting constrants?) etc.  (must set sourcepath first time)
     - ?filter classes
     - ?change order
  * Check out graphviz html format for url-enabelling the graph, to add things like
     - edit code (must set sourcepath first time)
     - filter out classes
     ? change order 




Detailed release notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.4 Fixes and package grouping.
* Classes can now be shown grouped in packages
* Graphviz 2.24 fix: translates bgcolor:none to black, while prior versions translate to white! Fixed
* Default outputFormat is now png
* Properties page now initially invisible
* Non-image outputFormats like svg and pdf now works, even from form
* New skin, classicSpaced, that use graphviz options to get more 'space' around nodes. Contributed by Gavin Kromhout.
* Preferences defaults can now be configured
* Legend: not loaded before required, and brushed up
* GUI form state fixes: Hiding menu now conservers preferences; enter-key now synonymous with pushing 'Update'.
* DotBuilder now supports subgraphs

* (cleaned up CSS a bit)
* (reformatted code to 4 spaces indentation, not tabs)
