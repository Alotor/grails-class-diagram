Work-in-progress notes

* classSelection works on domainclasses only. 
* Bug: when using classSelection:  unmatched references (entities & enums) are shown! 
* 



Detailed feature & issue list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unassigned
 (See JIRA - http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS/component/14031)
 * add packages in source to provide more consistent logging (according to http://grails.markmail.org/search/?q=list%3Adev+#query:list%3Adev%20+page:2+mid:uunlkazqvgpvhaqt+state:results)
 * GUI spinner should be bigger & positioned over the graph, and run until image finished loading!
 * Report errors on server (ex dot/format errors) as grails errors. Remove alert in ajax error
 * editable combobox on outputFormat
 * UI looks awful on IE7 (but who cares :)
 * DRY on plugin home URL (in ClassDiagramPlugin and in menubar)
 * Extend diagram to non-domain classes (services, controllers, etc. etc.) 
 * Draw seqeuence diagrams based on recording (using meta.invokeMethod), and possibly UMLGraph.org (think graphviz is unsuited)
 * prefix class name with package (in nodename) to avoid name collissions. 
 * examine on which os jpg+waitFor fails
 * Keyboard shortcuts on menu

 * static transients doens work. See http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS-2053
 * Provide different formatting for embedded/enums!
 * Log error: "Something went wrong..." to log4j
 * More sensible error message when dot generation fails
 * Test install in sts (0.5.1 failed because dot not found, but 0.5.2 untested).
 * When many relations between objecs, we show only one w/multiple decorations!
 * Add dependency diagram: 
     User select test case/package: instrument code, graph!
 * Minimalise js, mm
 * release 1.0!
 * try spock for testing!
 * (optional show stereotype)
 * Check if GORM-JPA works on my plugin
 * Still trouble with pdf in firefox!
 * Make screencast with screentoaster; -> Youtube!
 - Check out modsl (plain java graphing toolkit (google 'class diagram')
 - add coloring (list of regexp/colors)
 - JIRA cleanup
     - Add release 0.6
     - Report unreported bugs in JIRA


 Out on the limb
  * Cut restart time by having a separate server for the class diagram viewer (kind of like the grails console), that loads/reloads the domain classes only using application.addDomanClass/addArtifact or something similar?
     - Modularize and create eclipse-plugin ? 
  * Graphviz can attach urls to svg images. Here we could do a number of things:
     - add support for graph editing! (Or no? server reload takes too long!)
     - better: add support for browsing packages and classes, show source (intersting constrants?) etc.  (must set sourcepath first time)
     - ?filter classes
     - ?change order
  * Check out graphviz html format for url-enabelling the graph, to add things like
     - edit code (must set sourcepath first time)
     - filter out classes
     ? change order
